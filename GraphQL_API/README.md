 Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project)

## Background Context

In this project, you will create an application using a query language, designed to make APIs fast, flexible and developer-friendly. In the first part, you will create the back-end part using ExpressJs and set up GraphQl with all the parts (schema, root query and resolve function). In second part, you will connect your back-end to mongoDB and test your queries to GraphQL server using Graphiql. In the last part, you will create the front-end part using ReactJS and the GraphQL Client Apollo.

- GraphQL
- GraphQL: Schemas and Types

- What GraphQL means
- What is Graphiql
- How to test queries using Graphiql
- What is Apollo
- How to connect to mongoDB
- How to make queries from React
- How to make GraphQL server accept request from another server
